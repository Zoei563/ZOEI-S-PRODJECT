  <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi, my name is Zoei Peters. I like to hang out with my friends. I also like eating <a href="https://chardonicecream.ca/menu/">ice-cream with blue raspberry dip</a> from <a href="https://chardonicecream.ca/">Chardon</a>.</p>

  <p>I learned to code websites.</p>

  <h3>How to Code a Website? (For Kids)</h3>
  <p>Imagine you're building a house with LEGO bricks. HTML is like the instruction manual for building a website, and the LEGO bricks are the different parts of the website, like text, pictures, and buttons.</p>
  <p>First, we need a base for our house, right? In HTML, that's called the "HTML tag." It's like saying, "Hey, this is the start of our website!"</p>
  <p>Then, we need walls, a roof, and everything else. Those are like different parts of our website. We use different tags in HTML to make these parts, like the "head" tag for the brainy stuff (like the title of our site) and the "body" tag for the fun stuff (like the text and pictures).</p>
  <p>Now, let's add some decorations! We can use tags like "h1" for big headings, "p" for paragraphs, and "img" for images.</p>
  <p>Oh, and don't forget about links! You know, like when you click on a door in our LEGO house and it takes you to another room. We use the "a" tag in HTML for that.</p>
  <p>Finally, when we're done, we must tell the computer, "Hey, we're finished!" That's where the closing tags come in. They say, "That's the end of this part!"</p>
  <p>And that's it! We've built our website with HTML, just like building a house with LEGO bricks. Cool, huh?</p>
  
  <h3>How to Code a Website (For Adults)</h3>
  <p>Coding, also known as programming, is the process of creating instructions that a computer can understand and execute. These instructions are written in a specific language designed for computers. Here’s a breakdown to help explain it:</p>
  <p>
    1. <strong>Understanding the Basics</strong><br>
    Code: Just like we use English or Spanish to communicate, computers use programming languages. Code is the set of instructions written in a programming language.<br>
    Programming Languages: There are many different programming languages, each with its own rules and uses. Common ones include Python, JavaScript, Java, and C++.<br>
    Programs: A program is a collection of code that performs a specific task. For example, a web browser or a mobile app is a program.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. <strong>How Coding Works</strong><br>
    Writing Code: When you write code, you’re creating a set of instructions for the computer. For example, telling the computer to add two numbers or display a message on the screen.<br>
    Executing Code: Once the code is written, it needs to be executed (or run) by the computer. The computer reads the code and performs the tasks as instructed.<br>
    Debugging: Sometimes the code doesn’t work as expected. Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in the code.
  </p>
  <p>
    3. <strong>Why Coding is Important</strong><br>
    Automation: Coding allows us to automate repetitive tasks. For example, a script can automate data entry or send scheduled emails.<br>
    Problem-Solving: Coding helps in solving complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable parts.<br>
    Creation: Coding is used to create websites, apps, games, and software, shaping how we interact with technology daily.
  </p>
  <p>
    4. <strong>Real-World Examples</strong><br>
    Web Development: Coding is used to create websites. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are common languages for web development.<br>
    Software Development: Programs like Microsoft Word or Photoshop are created with programming languages.<br>
    Mobile Apps: Apps on your smartphone, like WhatsApp or Instagram, are built using languages such as Swift (for iOS) or Kotlin (for Android).
  </p>
  <p>
    5. <strong>Learning to Code</strong><br>
    Resources: There are many online resources available, such as free courses, tutorials, and coding boot camps.<br>
    Practice:Like any skill, coding requires practice. Start with small projects and gradually take on more complex ones.<br>
    Community: Joining coding communities can provide support, feedback, and collaboration opportunities.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example to Illustrate</strong><br>
    Imagine you want to teach the computer to make a sandwich:<br>
    Instruction: Get two slices of bread.<br>
    Instruction: Spread peanut butter on one slice.<br>
    Instruction: Spread jelly on the other slice.<br>
    Instruction: Put the slices together.<br>
    Each step is a line of code, and together, they form a simple program to make a sandwich. If one step is missing or incorrect, the sandwich won’t be made properly, much like how a program won't run correctly if there’s an error in the code.

  <p>I learned about Graphics.</p>
  <h3>What are Graphics?</h3>

  <p>Imagine you're drawing a picture, but instead of using paper and crayons, you're using a computer. Computer graphics are all about creating images and animations using computers.</p>
  <p>Here's a bit more detail:</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Pixels:</strong> Think of a computer screen as a giant grid made up of tiny dots called pixels. Each pixel can be a different colour, and by changing the colours of these pixels, we can create pictures.<br>
    <strong>2D Graphics:</strong> This is like drawing flat images, similar to cartoons or comics. You can create pictures with shapes, lines, and colours. Programs like Photoshop or Paint are used to make 2D graphics.<br>
    <strong>3D Graphics:</strong> Imagine building models out of clay or Lego but on the computer. In 3D graphics, you create objects in three dimensions (width, height, and depth). These objects can be rotated and viewed from different angles. Programs like Blender or the ones used to create video games and movies work with 3D graphics.<br>
    <strong>Rendering:</strong> This is the process of turning your 3D models into the final image or animation. It's like taking a photo of your Lego model but with lots of details like lighting, shadows, and textures.<br>
    <strong>Animation:</strong> This is making your images move. Just like a flipbook where you draw a picture on each page and flip through them to make the pictures move, computer graphics can create animations by showing a sequence of images quickly.
  </p>
  <p>In essence, computer graphics are all about creating and manipulating images using technology. Whether it's the characters in a video game, the special effects in a movie, or the icons on your phone, computer graphics bring all these visuals to life!</p>

  <h3>What is Robotics?</h3>
  <p>I learned about Robotics.</p>

  <h3>What is Robotics?</h3>
  <p>Robotics is a multi-disciplinary field that contains the integration of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science. It involves the whole cycle of developing intelligent machines, from conceptualizing and designing the robots to their manufacturing and programming, culminating in their operation to execute detailed tasks. The primary goal of robotics is to create robots with the capability to perceive and interact with their surroundings, effectively assisting humans across various domains such as manufacturing, healthcare, exploration, and more.</p>
  <p>Picture envisioning an incredible toy robot that possesses the ability to move, manipulate objects, and engage in conversation with you. Now, contemplate the intricate inner workings of this robot. It is comprised of specialized components that enable it to perform these extraordinary feats.

Now, envision the creation of a similar robot, but instead of a mere toy, it is a real machine capable of assisting people in diverse ways. This encapsulates the essence of robotics – the scientific domain that encompasses the design, construction, and utilization of robots.

Robots serve as exceptionally beneficial aids, undertaking tasks that are perilous or intricate for humans. For instance, certain robots venture into environments too hazardous for humans to access, such as deep underwater or outer space.

Moreover, robots are instrumental in aiding us in our daily lives. Some robots are proficient at completing household chores like vacuuming or mowing the lawn. Others assist surgeons during medical procedures or partake in the assembly of automobiles in manufacturing plants.

In essence, robotics entails the creation of machines that serve as invaluable allies, akin to fostering an extraordinary robot companion capable of performing a myriad of remarkable tasks.
